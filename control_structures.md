> ## If-else 
>This Control Structure allows a program to follow alternative paths of execution, whether a condition is met or not.

>    The execution of this construction is as follows:
>    - The condition is always evaluated.
         -  If the result is true only the statement block 1 is executed
         -  If the result is false only the statement block 2 is executed.

> ## Switch 
> The Switch Instruction is an alternative to the if instruction, and is characterized by the possibility to choose between more than two options. In pseudocode, it is known in different ways:

## Cycles 
>Stops the execution of the current iteration and returns the
control at the head of the loop by continuing its execution in the
next iteration.
These structures are repetitive problems since their solution is to use a set of actions that can be executed countless times can be determined or be based on some data.

## While 
> A while loop is a process in which a loop is initiated until a condition has been met. This structure is useful when performing iterative instructions to satisfy a cerntain parameter

## Do-while
> Is nearly the exact opposite to while loop. Initially checks to see if the parameter have been satisfaced before executing on instruction.
> This means using "do-while" the sequence of actions will be performed at least once, despite obtaining a false value.

## For
> Is a extensi贸n of a while loop. Usually has 3 commands. The first is used to set a starting point (like =0). Second is the end of the condition and is run every round. Thrid is usually used to modify a value, used in the conditiom box.
