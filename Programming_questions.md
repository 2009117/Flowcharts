##  Silver- Exam Style Questions
 **Explain** Why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs? 
> Answer: Because the high-level language is easier to use. And easier to learn. I guest because they use a standardized commands

 What is a machine code?
> Answer: Is a code executed by a CPU. And use code only uses a binary digits.

Give and example of a high-level languaje.
> Answer: Python and JAVA

## Gold- Answer the following questions:
**Describe three differences** between low-level language and high-level languaje.
 > Answer: 

|  Diferences |            | 
|-----------|-------------|
|  Low-level | High levels 
| - You have to translate to a binary languaje  | - You can select a variaty of codes such as `IF...THEN...ELSE...`   |
| Looks more like a human language | Use a binary code               |

What does the traslator do?
> Answer: Help us to translated into a machine code to understand it.

Identify **two** types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?
> Answer:  
> 1. **Compiler:**  are used to translate a program writter in a high-level language into machine code. Once compiled, the translalted program file can be directly used by the computer. 
> 2. **Interpreter:** Are able to read, translated and execute. The interpreter stops when a line of code is reached that contains an error. 

## Platinum- Exam questions

What is the difference between an interpreter and compiler?
> Answer: 
> Diferences
**Interpreter translates** just one statement of the program at a time into a machine code 
**Compiler** scan the entire program and translates the whole into a machine code
An **interpreter** takes very less time to analyze the source code. But the time to execute is much slower.
A **compiler** takes a lot of time to analyze the source code. But the execute time is much faster.


What is assembly languaje?
> Answer: Is a type of low-level programming that is intended to comunicate directly with a computer's hardware. 

### A developers is writing a program
   The program is written ig a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. 
   a) Describre two differences between high-level language and machine code?
   - > Answer: 
   In high level code intructions use words. In a machine code use a binary code.  
   The high code is designed to be read by human programmers. And the machine code is ti be read and executed by the computer. 
   
   b) One type of translator is an interpreter.
 - i) **Describe** how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code.
 - > Answer:  Uses words called **mnemonics", such as LOAD, STORE AND and ADD. The structions are specific to the hardware. Finaly, every assembly language instruction is translated into a single machine code instruction.
 
 - ii) **State** the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into a machine code?
- > Answer: 
1). Microsoft Visual Studio  
2). GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)  
3). Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL)
